*Data*

Attached is a dataset of car fuel economy data. It comes from https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml.

The particular file is https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/epadata/vehicles.csv.zip "Datasets for All Model Years (1984–2019)”

The data dictionary is here: https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/index.shtml#vehicle

*Question*

1. Which manufacturer produces the most fuel efficient fleet of cars?

2. Build a model to predict city mpg (variable “UCity” in column BG).

3. How has fuel economy changed over time? Are there any other interesting insights or trends?


As well as a complete model for UCity with code, we are looking for a coherent data-story that examines UCity 
as well one or more aspects of the data such as the evolution of a car manufacturer(s), engine types, future mpg. 
It is up to you. This is a deliberately open-ended question that provides a chance to showcase your EDA, analysis, and presentation skills.

The expectations is that you should spend no more than 3-4 hours on this task. Given this time constraint it might not be possible to fully execute a thorough analysis, which is expected. Please add notes about additional steps that could be taken if more time was available.
